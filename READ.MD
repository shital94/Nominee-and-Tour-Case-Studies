Nominee and Tour Case Studies
This project is comprised of 2 case studies. The first of these case studies requires associates to write nominee data into a PS and write a
COBOL program to read and validate the data. Following this, the COBOL program must calculate new fields based on the existing data
and write the complete records into corresponding clusters/files based on whether the validation was successful or if there are any errors.
The second case study bridges the gap between COBOL and SQL. It deals with data that relates to tour guides and tour
destinations. Associates must create multiple SQL tables and write a COBOL program with embedded SQL to read data from the table,
perform validations and calculations, and write the resulting output to the tables and output files.
Roles / Responsibilities
1. Nominee Data Processing Specialist:
Responsible for writing nominee data into a PS (Physical Sequential) file and developing a COBOL
program to read and validate the data.
Executed data validation to ensure data accuracy and compliance with project requirements.
Calculated new fields based on existing data within the COBOL program.
Managed the organization of complete records into corresponding clusters/files based on successful
validation or error conditions.
2. COBOL Programmer:
Developed COBOL programs to facilitate data processing and transformation for both case studies.
Designed logic for data validation, calculation, and conditional routing to appropriate clusters or files.
Ensured the efficiency and accuracy of COBOL program execution.
1. SQL Database Administrator:
1. Played a key role in the second case study, creating multiple SQL tables to house tour guides and
tour destination data.
2. Utilized embedded SQL within the COBOL program to read data from these tables and perform
necessary validations and calculations.
3. Oversaw data storage and retrieval within SQL databases.
2. Data Integration Specialist:
1. Worked on bridging the gap between COBOL and SQL technologies in the second case study.
2. Orchestrated the seamless integration of data processing, validation, and calculation within the
COBOL program and SQL tables.
3. Ensured that the resulting output was accurately written to tables and output files.
3. Quality Assurance Analyst:
1. Conducted rigorous quality checks and validation processes to ensure the accuracy and compliance
of processed data.
2. Identified and addressed any data anomalies, errors, or discrepancies.
3. Collaborated closely with the development and database teams to refine processing methods for
optimal results.
4. Played a crucial role in upholding the project's quality standards and objectives.
